    </ul>
    <p>The objectives for our subpages</p>

    <p>The "Look and Feel" of our website</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Since our website is related to our school (it is our school's extra curricular activities) we decided to make it "look and feel" like our school. For example, we added the logo of our school, and added few pictures that are relevant to our school, we got the image from <a href="http://www.ais.edu.hk/">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> we are now making our subpages for our website</p>
    <p>some of the wireframe templates I made</p>
    <img src="wireframe of subpage1.png" width=600px>
    <p>and the second idea</p>
    <img src="wireframe of subpage 2.png" width=600px>
    <p>We have decided to create a github for our group with the members and share the templates, homepages and work on it together, so this will be our final template with our homepage</p>
    <ul>
      <li>HOW WE CREATED THE GITHUB:We made a new repositry through github.com and shared it with the members. We then clone it to desktop so we have a folder with the works we have done. Every time we make changes or make a new file, we can commit and sync through the github app and share it with eachother and work on it together</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="file:///Users/CTD-2/Desktop/CTD-Extra-Curricular-Activities-/Templates/index-DW.dwt">Our Final template for the subpages</a></p>
    <p>With our final template we have created the subpages, we are still adding informations about the club.</p>
